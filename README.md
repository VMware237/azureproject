# End to End Data Engineering Project

## Project Description
Harnessing the power of Azure cloud services, this project delved into the performance and trends of participants in the Tokyo Olympics. The Azure Data Engineering Project was a data-intensive endeavor, aiming to streamline data handling and amplify analytical capabilities to support evidence-based decision-making in the field of sports analytics.

## Technical Stack
- **Cloud Services**: Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau
- **Version Control**: GitHub for data integration and code management
- **Programming**: SQL for database queries

## My Contributions
### Azure Data Factory Pipeline
**Action**
- Set up and configured Azure Data Factory for ETL processes.
- Implemented data extraction from various sources and transformed it to meet analysis requirements.
- Loaded the transformed data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for further processing.
**Outcome**
- Ensured efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading processes tailored to the complex dynamics of Olympic sports data.

### Data Integration and Management
**Action**
- Integrated data from GitHub into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
**Outcome**
